---

### Payment Guard Insurance (Award-Winning Innovation)

**What it is:** First Digital Lending Insurance (DLI) product - coverage embedded in digital lending events

**Recognition:** 2024 Celent Model Insurer Award for Innovation Execution

**Celent's Quote:**
> "TruStage Payment Guard Insurance is an outstanding example of how to make insurance more accessible, relevant, and personalized for customers. TruStage has demonstrated that it's possible to put the customer in the center of the design."

**Results (first year):**
- $385M in loan balances protected
- 4 lending partnerships
- $2M in loan balances prevented from default

**Why it matters for R&D:**
- Proves TruStage can execute on product innovation
- Demonstrates embedded/contextual insurance capability (H2 in your framework)
- Shows internal appetite for "first of its kind" products

**Interview talking point:**
> "Payment Guard Insurance winning the Celent award is a strong signal about TruStage's innovation execution capability. I'm curious about the R&D process behind it - was this incubated through a formal R&D function, or emerged differently? Understanding that history would help me think about how to structure future innovation pipelines."

## Questions to Ask in Interviews

### About the Role

1. "How does R&D currently interface with TruStage Ventures? Are there opportunities to leverage portfolio company technologies or partnerships?"

2. "Payment Guard won the Celent award - can you walk me through how that innovation came about? Was it through a formal R&D process?"

3. "What's the current balance of the R&D portfolio across horizons? Where do you see the biggest gaps?"

4. "How does R&D work with the AI, Automation, and Innovation Enablement teams mentioned in the job description? What are the boundaries?"

### About Strategy

5. "The credit union channel is TruStage's historical strength. How does R&D prioritize CU-enabling innovations versus direct-to-consumer capabilities?"

6. "What's TruStage's perspective on emerging AI regulation in insurance - like Colorado's AI Act? How is R&D thinking about that?"

7. "With 93% credit union penetration, growth presumably comes from share of wallet or new products. How does that shape R&D priorities?"

### About Culture

8. "What does 'rigorous experimentation' look like here? What's the tolerance for projects that don't work out?"

9. "How do innovation ideas flow in - top-down strategic priorities, bottom-up from business units, external from Ventures portfolio?"

10. "The rebrand from CUNA Mutual to TruStage was recent. How has that affected the innovation culture or strategy?"

## Red Flags / Tensions to Probe

| Tension | Questions to Ask |
|---------|------------------|
| **Channel conflict** | Direct-to-consumer vs. CU partnership - how does R&D navigate? |
| **Rebrand recency** | TruStage brand is new (2023) - still establishing identity? |
| **Competition intensity** | Insuritas lawsuit suggests contentious market - is R&D defensive or offensive? |
| **Legacy tech** | OIPA modernization ongoing - how does legacy tech affect innovation speed? |
| **Ventures vs. Internal** | $400M in external startups - does internal R&D feel resourced comparably? |

---

## Connecting Research to Your Narrative

| Your Material | TruStage Connection |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Innovation Thesis** | "Trust is the moat" aligns with CU philosophy of "people helping people" |
| **De-Risk Narratives** | Ventures' 100% survival rate shows they value disciplined selection - speak their language |
| **Regulated Industry** | Insurance regulation + AI regulation (Colorado Act) - directly relevant |
| **Three Horizons** | Payment Guard = H2 success story; ask about H3 pipeline |

**Unified talking point:**
> "What attracts me to TruStage is the alignment between mission and opportunity. The credit union philosophy of people helping people is fundamentally about trust. As AI transforms insurance, I believe carriers who earn trust - through transparency, fairness, and responsible innovation - will win. TruStage's 90-year track record with credit unions is a foundation to build on. I want to help extend that trust into the AI era."

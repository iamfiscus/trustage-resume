# Brainstorm: Director of R&D at TruStage

## Step 1: Gather Requirements

### Topic/Problem
How to approach the Director of R&D role at TruStage - building leverage in enterprise R&D that translates research to business value.

### Goal
Generate approaches for:
- Translating research to business value
- De-risking technology investments
- Enabling competitive advantage
- Building systems that multiply impact

### Constraints
- **Regulated industry**: Insurance and financial services
- **Must partner with**: AI, Automation, Innovation Enablement teams
- **Portfolio balance**: H1 (incremental) / H2 (adjacent) / H3 (transformational)
- **Stakeholder complexity**: Technical and non-technical audiences

### Evaluation Criteria
| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Impact | 30% | Potential to create measurable business value |
| Feasibility | 25% | Can be executed with available resources |
| Alignment | 20% | Fits TruStage's strategic priorities |
| Speed | 15% | Time to first value |
| Risk | 10% | Regulatory and operational risk profile |

### Target Quantity

## Step 3: Cluster (Group Themes)

*Principle: 4-8 distinct clusters. Create structure from chaos.*

### Cluster 1: Tech-as-a-Service
*Mechanism: Productize research capabilities for self-service consumption*

Ideas: 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07

**Core insight**: Build once, use many times. Every tool that enables self-service multiplies capacity without adding headcount.

**Proof mapping**:
- `n8n-nodes-mcp` → 4.8M downloads (built in one sleepless night)
- Demonstrates: packaging capability for broad consumption

---

### Cluster 2: Enablement & Translation
*Mechanism: Make research legible to non-researchers*

Ideas: 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 29, 30, 34

**Core insight**: The gap between research and business isn't technical—it's linguistic. Translation is the bottleneck.

**Proof mapping**:
- `mcp-d3-server` → D3 via MCP (data viz for agents)
- Demonstrates: making technical capability accessible to non-experts

---

### Cluster 3: Pipeline Management
*Mechanism: Systematic flow from exploration to production*

Ideas: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21

**Core insight**: Most R&D dies in the gap between "interesting" and "shipped." The pipeline leaks at every stage.

**Proof mapping**:
- `ai-labs @ rvo` → built from 0, research → roadmap
- Demonstrates: taking ideas from exploration to production

---

### Cluster 4: Horizon Scanning
*Mechanism: Systematic detection of emerging opportunities and threats*

Ideas: 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28

**Core insight**: Being early to the right technology creates asymmetric advantage. Being early to the wrong one wastes resources.

**Proof mapping**:
- `questionable` → transformer.js (WebAI in browser)
- Demonstrates: early positioning in emerging tech spaces

---

### Cluster 5: Stakeholder Architecture
*Mechanism: Structured engagement that builds buy-in systematically*

Ideas: 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35

**Core insight**: Research without advocates dies. Advocacy without structure burns out champions.

---

### Cluster 6: Risk & Governance
*Mechanism: Enable speed while managing regulatory and operational risk*

Ideas: 36, 37, 38, 39, 40

**Core insight**: In regulated industries, governance isn't a blocker—it's a competitive moat when done well.

---

## Step 4: Converge (Evaluate & Select)

*Principle: Score against criteria. Select strongest options.*

### Scoring Matrix

| Cluster | Impact | Feasibility | Alignment | Speed | Risk | **Total** |
|---------|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|------|-----------|
| Tech-as-a-Service | 9 | 7 | 9 | 6 | 8 | **8.1** |
| Enablement & Translation | 8 | 8 | 9 | 8 | 9 | **8.3** |
| Pipeline Management | 9 | 6 | 9 | 5 | 7 | **7.6** |
| Horizon Scanning | 7 | 8 | 8 | 7 | 8 | **7.6** |
| Stakeholder Architecture | 7 | 9 | 8 | 9 | 9 | **8.0** |
| Risk & Governance | 6 | 7 | 9 | 6 | 9 | **7.2** |

### Top Selections (Ranked)

**1. Enablement & Translation (8.3)**
*Why*: Highest combined score. Addresses root cause of R&D-business gap. Low risk, fast to start.

**2. Tech-as-a-Service (8.1)**
*Why*: Highest impact potential. Creates compounding leverage. Aligns with TruStage digital strategy.

**3. Stakeholder Architecture (8.0)**
*Why*: Enables all other initiatives. Fast wins build political capital.

**4. Pipeline Management (7.6)**
*Why*: Fixes the leaky pipeline problem. Requires more setup but essential for scale.

**5. Horizon Scanning (7.6)**
*Why*: Maintains future-focused perspective. Partner opportunity with universities.

### Deprioritized (for now)
- **Risk & Governance (7.2)**: Important but can be integrated into other workstreams rather than standalone.

## Step 5: Document & Validate

### Problem Statement
TruStage needs a Director of R&D who can shape enterprise strategy, translate research to business value, and build systems that multiply impact across a regulated financial services organization.

### Key Pattern
Every requirement in the job description is about **multiplication**, not addition. The role isn't doing research—it's **building leverage**.

### Selected Approach (First 90 Days)
1. **Week 1-4**: Stakeholder mapping and listening tour
2. **Week 5-8**: Launch first enablement initiative (quick win)
3. **Week 9-12**: Design Tech-as-a-Service pilot
4. **Ongoing**: Build pipeline and horizon scanning in parallel

### Success Metrics
- Time from research insight to business decision
- Self-service tool adoption rate
- Research-to-production conversion rate
- Stakeholder satisfaction scores
- Patent/IP capture rate

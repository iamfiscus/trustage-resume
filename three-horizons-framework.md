# Three Horizons Innovation Framework

**Purpose:** Demonstrate fluency with the exact strategic framework the JD references ("horizon-one incremental improvements to horizon-three breakthrough innovations") and show you can apply it to R&D portfolio management.

---

## What Is the Three Horizons Framework?

The Three Horizons model is an innovation portfolio framework originally developed by McKinsey. It helps organizations balance short-term performance with long-term transformation by categorizing initiatives across three time horizons.

### The Core Idea

Organizations must simultaneously:
1. **Defend and extend** the current business (H1)
2. **Build emerging** opportunities (H2)
3. **Create options** for the future (H3)

Focusing only on H1 leads to disruption vulnerability. Focusing only on H3 means you run out of money before the future arrives. The art is in the balance.

## Your Experience Mapped to Horizons

Based on what you've shared, your experience spans all three horizons:

### Your H1 Experience (Core Operations)
- AI/ML implementations that delivered measurable operational improvements
- Process automation in healthcare/insurance
- Efficiency gains and cost reduction projects

### Your H2 Experience (Emerging Capabilities)
- New product/platform launches
- Building capabilities that extended into new use cases
- Cross-functional innovation initiatives

### Your H3 Experience (Future Options)
- **R&D lab you built from scratch** (directly relevant)
- Emerging technology evaluation and exploration
- University/startup partnerships
- Technical spikes on breakthrough technologies

**Key talking point:**
> "I've worked across all three horizons. In H1, I've delivered operational AI that generated measurable ROI. In H2, I've launched new products and built platforms. In H3, I built an R&D lab from scratch focused on emerging technology exploration. The skill is knowing which horizon you're in and applying the right approach—H1 needs efficiency and predictability, H3 needs experimentation and patience."

## Portfolio Balance: How to Discuss It

The JD mentions maintaining "a balanced R&D portfolio spanning horizon-one incremental improvements to horizon-three breakthrough innovations."

### The Classic Allocation

| Horizon | Typical Allocation | Risk/Return Profile |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| H1 | 50-70% | Low risk, predictable returns |
| H2 | 20-30% | Medium risk, growth potential |
| H3 | 10-20% | High risk, optionality value |

### Your Perspective (Context-Dependent)

> "I don't believe in a one-size-fits-all allocation. The right balance depends on several factors:
>
> **Company maturity:** Startups might be 20/30/50 (heavy H3), while established companies might be 70/20/10 (heavy H1).
>
> **Market dynamics:** Industries facing disruption need more H2/H3 investment. Stable industries can focus more on H1.
>
> **Financial health:** Strong cash position allows more H3 experimentation. Tighter resources require H1 focus.
>
> **For TruStage specifically,** I'd want to understand the current portfolio balance before recommending changes. Given the rapid evolution of AI and changing customer expectations, I'd hypothesize that increasing H2/H3 investment might be warranted—but that's a conversation to have with leadership, not a predetermined answer."

### Managing Across Horizons

| Horizon | Governance Approach | Success Metrics | Failure Mode |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| H1 | Tight project management | ROI, efficiency, quality | Over-investing in declining capabilities |
| H2 | Stage-gate with pivots | Revenue growth, capability | Premature scaling before product-market fit |
| H3 | Option-based, high tolerance | Learning, optionality | Expecting H1-style ROI from exploration |

**Key insight:**
> "The biggest mistake I see is applying H1 governance to H3 work. If you demand predictable ROI from breakthrough research, you'll kill every interesting idea. Conversely, if you run H1 operational improvements like exploratory research, you'll never capture efficiency gains. Matching governance to horizon is critical."

If asked to present your innovation framework, use this structure:

### Slide 1: The Challenge
- Insurance facing multiple disruption vectors (AI, embedded, changing expectations)
- Must deliver near-term value while building future capabilities
- R&D needs a portfolio approach, not project-by-project thinking

### Slide 2: Three Horizons Framework
- Visual showing the three horizons (use diagram above)
- Brief explanation of each horizon
- Emphasize: "This is the exact framework referenced in TruStage's R&D strategy"

### Slide 3: Applied to Insurance
- H1: Operational AI (claims, underwriting, service)
- H2: New capabilities (embedded, personalization, prevention)
- H3: Future options (agentic, edge AI, new models)
- Specific examples for each

### Slide 4: Portfolio Management
- Balance depends on context (explain factors)

## Interview Questions & Responses

### "How do you think about balancing short-term and long-term innovation?"

> "I use the Three Horizons framework. Horizon 1 is defending and extending the core—operational improvements, efficiency gains, incremental enhancements. Horizon 2 is building emerging opportunities—new products, new capabilities, adjacent markets. Horizon 3 is creating options for the future—breakthrough technology exploration, research partnerships, emerging trends.
>
> The key insight is that each horizon requires different governance. H1 needs tight project management and predictable ROI. H3 needs patience and tolerance for failure—you're buying options, not commitments. Applying the wrong governance to the wrong horizon is how organizations kill innovation or waste resources.
>
> I've worked across all three. [Give brief examples from each horizon.]"

### "How would you structure TruStage's R&D portfolio?"

> "I'd start by understanding the current state before prescribing changes. But I can share my framework for thinking about it.
>
> First, I'd map existing initiatives to horizons. What's H1 operational improvement? What's H2 capability building? What's H3 exploration?
>
> Second, I'd assess the balance against TruStage's strategic context. Given AI acceleration and changing member expectations, my hypothesis is that H2/H3 might be underweighted—but I'd want to validate that.
>
> Third, I'd ensure governance matches horizons. Are we applying H1 ROI expectations to H3 research? Are we running H1 efficiency projects with H3-style open-ended exploration?
>
> Fourth, I'd establish clear metrics for each horizon. H1: cost savings, efficiency gains. H2: revenue from new sources, capability development. H3: learning captured, options created.
>
> The framework in your job description—'horizon-one incremental improvements to horizon-three breakthrough innovations'—is exactly how I think about this."

### "What's in your Horizon 3 view of insurance?"

> "Several things I'm watching:
>
> **Agentic commerce:** AI agents that negotiate and purchase on behalf of customers. When customers delegate insurance decisions to agents, the carriers that those agents trust become the default choice. This is why I believe trust becomes the competitive moat.
>
> **Edge AI:** Privacy-preserving intelligence that runs on devices rather than centralized servers. This enables personalization without data exposure—a potential breakthrough for customer trust.
>
> **Parametric insurance:** Automatic, trigger-based payouts without claims processes. Fundamentally changes the customer experience and operational model.
>
> **Climate adaptation:** Both the products (new risk coverage) and the technology (predictive modeling for emerging risks).
>
> These are explorations, not predictions. The point of H3 is creating options—understanding these trends well enough to act quickly when the timing is right."

## Connection to Your Other Materials

| Document | Three Horizons Connection |
|----------|---------------------------|
| **Innovation Thesis** | Trust thread across all horizons; H3 is where trust becomes the moat |
| **De-Risk Narratives** | Different de-risking approaches for different horizons |
| **Regulated Industry** | Compliance considerations vary by horizon (H1 operational vs. H3 exploratory) |

**Unified narrative:**
> "My innovation thesis is that trust becomes the competitive advantage as AI capabilities commoditize. The Three Horizons framework is how I operationalize that: H1 builds trust through reliable, transparent operations. H2 builds trust through demonstrated value exchange for data sharing. H3 positions us for a future where trust is the moat. Every horizon contributes to the trust strategy."

# Interview Prep Sheet: TruStage Director of R&D

**Quick-reference guide for interview preparation**

---

## Your Positioning Statement

> "I'm a technology innovation leader who has built R&D capabilities from the ground up, deployed AI systems that deliver measurable business outcomes, and navigated the complexities of regulated industries. My core belief is that **trust becomes the competitive advantage** as AI capabilities commoditize. I bring the rare combination of technical depth in AI/ML, strategic vision for innovation portfolios, and the leadership presence to drive adoption across an enterprise."

---

## The Three Things They Need to Believe

1. **You can build and lead R&D** → Your R&D lab you built from scratch
2. **You deliver business outcomes, not just experiments** → De-risk narratives with metrics
3. **You understand regulated industries** → Healthcare/insurance experience + AI compliance

---

## Your Core Thesis (Memorize This)

> "Trust is the moat. In a world where every carrier will have access to the same AI, the sustainable competitive advantage isn't who adopts first—it's who earns the right to use customer data in increasingly intimate ways. The more powerful AI becomes, the more trust matters."

---

## 60-Second Narratives

### When Asked: "Tell me about yourself"

> "I've spent my career at the intersection of emerging technology and business value—in healthcare, insurance, startups, and enterprise consulting at Accenture. Three things define my approach:
>
> First, I **build from scratch**. I've stood up an R&D lab where none existed, creating the frameworks, processes, and culture for disciplined innovation.
>
> Second, I **deliver outcomes**. My AI/ML work has generated [SPECIFIC METRICS]. I focus on production deployment, not just experimentation.
>
> Third, I **navigate complexity**. I've deployed compliant AI systems in regulated industries, working with legal, compliance, and risk teams as partners, not blockers.
>
> What draws me to TruStage is the mission alignment. 'Making a brighter financial future accessible to everyone' is fundamentally about trust—and I believe trust is where the next competitive advantage in insurance will be won."

---

### When Asked: "Why TruStage?"

> "Three reasons:
>
> **Mission alignment.** 'People helping people' isn't just a slogan for credit unions—it's a trust model. As AI transforms insurance, I believe carriers who earn trust will win. TruStage's 90-year track record with credit unions is a foundation to build on.
>
> **Innovation track record.** Payment Guard winning the Celent award, $400M invested through Ventures, the Discovery Fund's 100% survival rate—this is an organization that knows how to innovate, not just talk about it.
>
> **The challenge.** Building enterprise R&D that spans horizons one through three, in a regulated industry, with AI evolving rapidly—that's exactly the kind of complex problem I want to solve."

---

### When Asked: "How do you de-risk technology investments?"

> "I use a disciplined approach with four elements:
>
> **Kill criteria upfront.** Before any investment, we define what failure looks like. If we hit those thresholds, we stop—no sunk cost fallacy.
>
> **Phased pilots.** We don't go from POC to enterprise rollout. We expand in stages with go/no-go gates at each phase.
>
> **Evaluation frameworks.** For build-vs-buy or technology selection, I use structured scoring with weighted criteria. This removes politics and opinion from decisions.
>
> **Early compliance engagement.** In regulated industries, I bring compliance in during design, not at the end. This actually accelerates delivery.
>
> [Give specific example with metrics]"

---

### When Asked: "Tell me about your regulated industry experience"

> "I've deployed AI systems in healthcare and insurance—two of the most regulated industries. The key lesson: **constraints drive creativity**.
>
> When you must explain AI decisions to regulators, you build more interpretable models. When you must test for fairness, you catch data quality issues. When you need audit trails, you create better documentation.
>
> My approach: treat regulation as a design input, not a post-hoc checkbox. Bring compliance, legal, and risk teams in early. Build compliance into the architecture.
>
> The specific challenges I've navigated: [explainability, fairness testing, data privacy, model governance]. I can do this for insurance-specific regulations like state commissioner requirements and emerging AI legislation like Colorado's AI Act."

---

### When Asked: "How do you balance short-term and long-term innovation?"

> "I use the Three Horizons framework:
>
> **Horizon 1** (0-2 years): Defend and extend the core. Operational AI, efficiency improvements. Tight governance, predictable ROI.
>
> **Horizon 2** (2-5 years): Build emerging opportunities. New products, new capabilities. Stage-gate governance, growth metrics.
>
> **Horizon 3** (5-10 years): Create options for the future. Breakthrough research, emerging tech exploration. Patient governance, learning metrics.
>
> The critical insight: **match governance to horizon**. If you demand H1-style ROI from H3 research, you kill every interesting idea. If you run H1 operations like H3 exploration, you never capture efficiency gains.
>
> I've worked across all three horizons and know how to manage a balanced portfolio."

2. "Payment Guard won the Celent award—can you walk me through how that innovation came about? Was it through a formal R&D process?"

3. "What's the current balance of the R&D portfolio across horizons? Where do you see the biggest gaps?"

### About Strategy
4. "With 93% credit union penetration, growth presumably comes from share of wallet or new products. How does that shape R&D priorities?"

6. "How does R&D prioritize credit union-enabling innovations versus direct-to-consumer capabilities?"

### About Culture

### Closing Question
9. "What would success look like for this role in the first year?"

#### 4. Regulated Industry Experience Narrative (Score: 35)
JD lists regulated industry experience as preferred. A compelling story about navigating compliance, governance, and innovation tensions is highly relevant and reduces perceived onboarding risk.

#### 5. Three Horizons Innovation Framework (Score: 34)

#### 6. TruStage-Specific Research & Context (Score: 33)
Highest feasibility. Understanding their current initiatives, technology partners, and strategic priorities enables tailored responses in interviews and demonstrates genuine interest.

#### 7. AI/Automation/Innovation Enablement Documentation (Score: 33)

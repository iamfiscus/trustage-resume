## Forecast 1: Agentic Commerce Handling >10% of Online Retail Transactions by 2030

### Final Probability: 12%
**Confidence Interval (80%):** 5% - 25%

### Reasoning Pipeline

**Phase 1: Outside View (Base Rate)**
- Reference Classes: E-commerce (20 years to 10%), M-commerce (3-4 years to 10% of e-commerce), Voice commerce (FAILED)
- Base Rate: 15-20%
- Key Insight: Voice commerce is closest analogue and failed despite favorable predictions. Trust barrier is primary.
- Sources: US Census Bureau, eMarketer, OC&C Strategy Consultants

**Phase 2: Decomposition (Structural)**
| Component | Estimate | Reasoning |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Technical capability | 85% | GPT-4 class models already demonstrate shopping assistance |

| Retailer infrastructure | 70% | APIs exist; agent-friendly design emerging |
| Regulatory permits | 75% | No current blocking regulations |
| Economic incentive | 65% | Value prop exists but not yet proven at scale |

**Combined (AND logic):** 10.1%
**Reconciled with base rate:** 15%

**Phase 3: Bayesian Update**
| Evidence | LR | Updated | Reasoning |
|----------|-----|---------|-----------|
| Amazon Rufus/Perplexity investing | 1.4 | 19% | Major players indicate trajectory |

| Low consumer trust surveys | 0.75 | 13% | Trust barrier may not resolve |
| Only 4 years timeline | 0.85 | 13% | Time constraint severe |

**Phase 4: Stress Test**
- Premortem failure modes: Trust Chasm (35%), Last Mile Problem (25%), Adversarial Environment (20%)
- Tech hype bias adjustment applied
- **Final:** 12%

### Kill Criteria
- Major AI-agent security breach (>$100M losses) → Drops to 3%
- FTC/EU bans autonomous purchasing → Drops to 2%
- Amazon/Walmart refuse agent APIs by 2028 → Drops to 5%

**Phase 2: Decomposition**
| Component | Estimate | Reasoning |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Technical readiness | 90% | Current LLMs nearly sufficient |
| Competitive pressure | 70% | AI arms race in retail is real |
| ROI positive | 60% | Uncertain; cost savings vs. implementation |
| No trust-breaking incidents | 65% | Moderate risk of early failures |

**Combined:** 24.6% for success at scale
**Adjusted for "deploy" interpretation:** 55-65%

**Phase 3: Bayesian Update**

## Forecast 4: Human-Level Complex Purchases (Travel, Insurance) by 2028

### Final Probability: 12%
**Confidence Interval (80%):** 4% - 28%

### Definition Sensitivity
- "Human-level" as "handles 90% of cases correctly": ~25%
- "Human-level" as "indistinguishable from skilled travel agent": ~8%
- **Used middle interpretation:** ~12%

### Reasoning Pipeline

**Phase 1: Outside View**
- Reference Class: AI capability milestones, automation of complex cognitive tasks

| Travel/insurance API fragmentation | 0.7 | 16% | Integration challenge persists |
| "Computer use" capabilities | 1.4 | 21% | Screen-based interaction helps |
| Edge case handling still poor | 0.75 | 17% | Error recovery not human-level |
| "Human-level" high bar | 0.9 | 15% | Conservative benchmark |

**Phase 4: Stress Test**
- "Human-level" definition problematic
- Travel/insurance have adversarial dynamics (upselling, complex terms)
- Tech hype bias adjustment applied
- **Adjustment:** 15% → 12%

### Kill Criteria
- AI capability progress stalls 2026 → Drops to 5%
- Travel/insurance block agent APIs → Drops to 4%
- No multi-step reasoning improvements → Drops to 6%

## Premortem Analysis: How Agentic Commerce Could Fail

### Major Failure Modes Identified

| Failure Mode | Probability | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| The Trust Chasm | 35% | Consumers unwilling to delegate purchasing authority; high-profile failures destroy confidence |
| Adversarial Environment | 20% | Retailers optimize to manipulate agents rather than serve consumers; "Agent SEO" creates adversarial dynamics |
| Liability Uncertainty | 15% | Who's responsible when agent makes bad purchase? Class action lawsuits, insurance refuses coverage |
| The "Last Mile" Problem | 25% | Agents handle 80% well but fail on the 20% that matter most; users can't fully trust |
| Incumbent Resistance | 15% | Amazon/Walmart prefer proprietary experiences; walled gardens prevent interoperability |
| Economic Downturn | 10% | Recession causes retailers to cut AI investment |

## Risk Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Signals to Track

| Metric | Positive Signal | Negative Signal | Frequency |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Agent transaction volume | Growing >50% QoQ | Flat or declining | Quarterly |
| Major retailer announcements | New agent deployments | Rollbacks/discontinuations | Monthly |
| Consumer trust surveys | Willingness >25% | Willingness <10% | Annually |
| Enterprise adoption news | SAP/Oracle case studies | Integration failures | Quarterly |
| Regulatory activity | Light-touch regulation | Restrictive rules passed | Monthly |
| AI capability benchmarks | Continued improvements | Plateau in reasoning | Quarterly |

---

## Forecast Quality Assessment

| Question | Brier Risk | Evidence Quality | Confidence |
|----------|------------|------------------|------------|
| >10% by 2030 | Low (moderate prob) | Moderate | Low |
| Retailers 2027 | Medium (higher prob) | Strong | Medium |
| B2B $100B 2028 | Low (moderate prob) | Moderate | Low |
| Human-level 2028 | Low (low prob) | Weak | Low |

### Key Uncertainties
1. Consumer trust trajectory for autonomous purchasing
2. Definition ambiguity ("deploy", "human-level")
3. Regulatory evolution
4. AI capability trajectory post-2025

### Strongest Convictions
1. Major retailers WILL experiment with purchasing agents (Q2 highest probability)
2. Consumer trust is the primary bottleneck (not technology)
3. B2B adoption will lag consumer due to integration complexity

---

## Key Takeaway

The forecasts are deliberately conservative, anchored by the **voice commerce failure precedent**. The core insight is that Agentic Commerce requires consumers to delegate decision-making authority - a psychological barrier that may prove more significant than technological barriers. Major retailers will deploy agents (high confidence), but widespread consumer adoption remains uncertain.

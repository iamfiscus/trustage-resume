## Kill Criteria & Monitoring

### Events That Would Dramatically Shift Forecasts

| OpenAI announces MCP support | Dominant → 25%, Major providers → 40% |
| Google/Microsoft consortium forms (excluding MCP) | All forecasts -50% relative |
| MCP servers plateau at <500 for 6 months | 10K servers → 8% |
| Major security breach via MCP | All forecasts -40% relative |
| Anthropic acquires or is acquired | High uncertainty spike; reevaluate all |

### Monitoring Signposts

| Signal | Frequency | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| MCP GitHub stars / server count | Monthly | mcp.io, GitHub |
| OpenAI/Google/Meta announcements re: tool protocols | Weekly | Company blogs, developer conferences |
| Enterprise case studies mentioning MCP | Quarterly | Industry reports |
| LangChain/LangGraph MCP integration depth | Monthly | Release notes |

## Premortem Analysis

### Failure Modes Identified

| Failure Mode | Probability | Description |

| Google/Microsoft consortium standard | 25% | IETF-backed "AI Tool Interchange Format" with broader support |
| LangChain/LangGraph becomes de facto | 15% | Abstraction layer wins; protocol choice becomes irrelevant |

## Reference Class Analysis

### Protocol Adoption Historical Data

| Protocol | Origin | Years to Mainstream | Peak Share | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------------|------------|-------|
| OAuth 1.0 | 2007 | ~5 years | 80%+ | Became standard |
| GraphQL | 2015 | ~6 years | ~30% | Successful but not dominant |
| gRPC | 2015 | ~5 years | ~15-20% | Niche adoption |
| OpenAPI/Swagger | 2011 | ~4 years | 60%+ | Industry standard |
| JSON-RPC | 2005 | ~3 years | ~40% | Widespread but not dominant |

### Key Insight
Only ~10-20% of well-backed protocols achieve true dominance (>50% share). Most successful protocols take 4-6 years to reach mainstream adoption.

## Key Takeaways for Decision-Making

1. **MCP's path to dominance is unlikely but not impossible (7%)** - The protocol would need several things to go right: no strong competitor emergence, network effects activating, and either competitor adoption or neutrality.

2. **Major provider adoption is the key swing factor** - If OpenAI or Google adopted MCP, all forecasts would shift dramatically upward. Monitor their announcements closely.

3. **Ecosystem growth is the most achievable near-term metric (24%)** - The 10K server target is plausible given typical open-source growth curves, but requires sustained momentum.

4. **Enterprise adoption faces structural barriers (5.5%)** - Even if MCP succeeds in developer adoption, Fortune 500 penetration requires enterprise-grade features, vendor ecosystems, and procurement buy-in that take years to develop.

5. **Tail risks are significant in both directions** - A single announcement (OpenAI adopting or competing) could move these probabilities 3-5x in either direction.
